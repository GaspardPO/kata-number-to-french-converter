Number can be hard to write in French.

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nombres_en_français

Some rules:

## the units
less than 10, or less than 16 follow no rules but each has a specific name.  
"zéro", "un", "deux", "trois", "quatre", "cinq", "six", "sept", "huit", "neuf", "dix", "onze", "douze", "treize", "quatorze", "quinze", "seize"  
(from 0 to 16)

## the tens
as French up to 60, or using Belgium-French (septante, huitante, nonante), up to 90, follow the same pattern :   
"dix", "vingt", "trente", "quarante", "cinquante", "soixante", "septante", "huitante", "nonante"  
(from 10 to 90)  
"huitante" could also be "octante"  
  
In French from France, the pattern change at 70:  
70 = 60+10 =  "soixante-dix"  
80 = 4 * 20 = "quatre-vingts"  
90 = 4*20 + 10 = "quatre-vingt-dix" (because why not!)  


## number from 22 to 29, then 32 to 39 ...
the rule is easy:  
22 = 20 + 2 = "vingt-deux", with a dash in between

## number ending with 1:
the rule is the same as above, but with "-et-" which means "and" instead of "-".    
21 = "vingt-et-un"  
Before 1990, the writing was "vingt et un" but since [the 1990 simplification reform](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Annexe:Rectifications_orthographiques_du_fran%C3%A7ais_en_1990#Num%C3%A9raux_compos%C3%A9s), all words used for numbers are joined-up with dashes.  

## number after 70 and 90:
74 = 60 + 14 = "soixante-quatorze"  
77 = 60 + 17 = 60 + 10 + 7 = "soixante-dix-sept"  
95 = 4*20 + 15 = "quatre-vingt-quinze"  
99 = 4 * 20 + 10 + 9 = "quatre-vingt-dix-neuf"

_**plural form of "quatre-vingt"**  
"quatre-vingt**s**" means 4 times 20.  
Because several times 20, 20 is plural, so "vingt**s**" ends with an "s".  
**But** when it is not the ending of the word, the plural form disappear.  
and 82 becames "quatre-vingt-deux", without an "s" at "vingt"._

## 71, 81, 91
For some unknow reason, 71 use an "-et-", 81 and 91 use a dash.  
71 = 60 + 11 = "soixante-et-onze"  
81 = 4*20 + 1 = "quatre-vingt-un"  
91 = 4*20 + 11 = "quatre-vingt-onze"

## 100 and more
One hundred is "cent".  
Then the rule is joining this and the rest with a dash:  
130 = 100 + 30 = "cent-trente"  

_**plural form of "cent"**  
Like 80, 100 can be plural if it ends a word and then takes an S: "cents"  
200 = 2 * 100 = "deux-cents"  
When "cent" is not ending the word, then it is not plural:  
252 = 2 * 100 + 52 = "deux-cent-cinquante-deux"
